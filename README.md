# Climate Change and Finance

This is a project for the UZH course on Climate Chance and Finance. This course is taught by Professor Stefano Battiston.

## Aim
We try to establish a climate change related portfolio and measure the risk of it.

## Tasks
- [ ] Fill missing data points (if not too many) in time series using interpolation function 
- [ ] Produce a consolidated dataset comprising a subset of companies for which technology info is available AND price time series are usable.
- [ ] Group companies into a greener and less green set
- [ ] Compute ES on the distribution of quarterly returns (assuming a buy and hold strategy) of each ptf before and during COVID. Draw distributions and report results.
- [ ] Bonus points: adjust ES for transition risk in the future based on calculations in classwork and comment.
